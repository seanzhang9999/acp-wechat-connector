# WeChat ACP

[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/d18m/wechat-acp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechat-acp)

Bridge WeChat direct messages to any ACP-compatible AI agent.

`wechat-acp` logs in with the WeChat iLink bot API, polls incoming 1:1 messages, forwards them to an ACP agent over stdio, and sends the agent reply back to WeChat.

## Features

- WeChat QR login with terminal QR rendering
- One ACP agent session per WeChat user
- Built-in ACP agent presets for common CLIs
- Custom raw agent command support
- Agent image output delivered as native WeChat image messages
- Agent audio, embedded resources, and generated files delivered to WeChat
- Auto-allow permission requests from the agent
- Direct message only; group chats are ignored
- Background daemon mode

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- A WeChat environment that can use the iLink bot API
- An ACP-compatible agent available locally or through `npx`

## Quick Start

Start with a built-in agent preset:

```bash
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --agent copilot
```

Or use a raw custom command:

```bash
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --agent "npx my-agent --acp"
```

On first run, the bridge will:

1. Start WeChat QR login
2. Render a QR code in the terminal
3. Save the login token under `~/.wechat-acp`
4. Begin polling direct messages

## Trying preview builds

Every push to `main` is automatically published to npm under the `next` dist-tag, so you can try unreleased changes without waiting for a tagged release:

```bash
npx -y wechat-acp@next --agent copilot
```

These versions are tagged `<base>-next.<UTC-timestamp>.<short-sha>` (e.g. `0.7.1-next.202605311530.abc1234`, where `0.7.1` is the next patch above whatever `@latest` is). They are built from `main` after CI passes, but have not been through a release review — expect rough edges. Stable users should keep using `wechat-acp@latest`.

## Built-in Agent Presets

List the bundled presets:

```bash
npx wechat-acp agents
```

Current presets:

- `copilot`
- `claude`
- `gemini`
- `qwen`
- `codex`
- `opencode`
- `openclaw`
- `kiro`
- `hermes`
- `kimi`
- `pi`

These presets resolve to concrete `command + args` pairs internally, so users do not need to type long `npx ...` commands.

## CLI Usage

```text
wechat-acp --agent <preset|command> [options]
wechat-acp agents
wechat-acp inject --text <text>
wechat-acp stop
wechat-acp status
```

Options:

- `--agent <value>`: built-in preset name or raw agent command
- `--cwd <dir>`: working directory for the agent process
- `--login`: force QR re-login and replace the saved token
- `--daemon`: run in background after startup
- `--config <file>`: load JSON config file
- `--instance <name>`: run as a named, isolated instance. See "Running multiple instances" below.
- `--idle-timeout <minutes>`: session idle timeout, default `1440` (use `0` for unlimited)
- `--max-sessions <count>`: maximum concurrent user sessions, default `10`
- `--session-resume <mode>`: persistence policy across bridge restarts: `off` (default), `auto`, or `required`
- `--turn-end-message <text>`: send a standalone message after each completed agent turn (default: disabled)
- `--inbox-dir <dir>`: directory where received binary files are saved (default: `<storage.dir>/inbox`). The agent sees the absolute saved path in the prompt and can read the file directly.
- `--no-inbox`: do not save received files; the agent only sees a size notice.
- `--hide-thoughts`: do not forward agent thinking to WeChat (default: forwarded)
- `--show-diffs`: forward ACP file diffs to WeChat (default: hidden)
- `--hide-images`: suppress inline images from tool calls. Explicit agent message images and attachments are still sent.
- `--hide-audio`: do not forward agent audio output to WeChat (default: forwarded)
- `--hide-resources`: do not forward intermediate tool resources to WeChat (default: forwarded). Explicit agent resources and files sent with `attach_file` are still delivered.
- `--resource-inline-limit <chars>`: render tool text resources up to this length inline and send longer ones as file attachments (default: `1000`; range: `0` to `4000`; use `0` to attach all non-empty tool text resources)
- `inject --text <text>`: enqueue a local text message for the running daemon
- `-V, --version`: print version and exit
- `-h, --help`: show help

Examples:

```bash
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --agent copilot
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --agent claude --cwd D:\code\project
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --agent "npx @github/copilot --acp"
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --agent gemini --daemon
```

## Running multiple instances

By default everything (saved login token, daemon pid/log, sync state, telemetry id) lives under `~/.wechat-acp/`, which means a single machine can only host one bridge at a time. Pass `--instance <name>` to namespace all of that under `~/.wechat-acp/instances/<name>/` and run several bridges side by side, each with its own WeChat account and project directory.

Typical setup: WeChat account 1 drives project A, WeChat account 2 drives project B.

```bash
# Terminal 1: scan with WeChat account 1
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --instance projA --agent copilot --cwd D:\code\repo-a

# Terminal 2: scan with WeChat account 2
npx -y wechat-acp@latest --instance projB --agent copilot --cwd D:\code\repo-b
```

The first run of each instance prints its own QR code. Tokens are saved per instance, so subsequent runs reuse them independently.

The `stop` and `status` subcommands also honor `--instance`:

```bash
npx -y wechat-acp@latest status --instance projA
npx -y wechat-acp@latest stop   --instance projB
```

Without `--instance`, paths fall back to `~/.wechat-acp/` exactly as before, so existing installs are unaffected.

## Configuration File

You can provide a JSON config file with `--config`.

Example:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "preset": "copilot",
    "cwd": "D:/code/project",
    "showDiffs": true,
    "resourceInlineLimit": 1000
  },
  "session": {
    "idleTimeoutMs": 86400000,
    "maxConcurrentUsers": 10,
    "resume": "auto",
    "turnEndMessage": "✅ Turn complete"
  }
}
```

`session.resume` controls whether each WeChat user's ACP conversation is
restored after the bridge restarts:

- `off` keeps the existing behavior and always starts a new ACP session.
- `auto` loads a saved session when the agent advertises the ACP
  `loadSession` capability. It starts a new session when loading is unsupported
  or the saved session no longer exists, but surfaces other load failures.
- `required` requires an existing saved session to load successfully. A user
  without a saved session can still start their first conversation.

Session IDs are saved only after the first prompt completes. Loading replays
history at the ACP protocol level, but the bridge suppresses that replay so old
messages are not sent to WeChat again. Sessions are isolated by agent and
absolute working directory: built-in presets use their stable preset ID, while
raw agents use their command and arguments. Environment variables are never
stored or included in the identity.

`session.turnEndMessage` is optional. When set to a non-empty string, the
bridge sends it as a standalone WeChat message after the ACP prompt resolves
and all output from that turn has been delivered. This makes the real turn
boundary visible even when the agent streamed several earlier messages or was
silent during a long-running tool call. The bridge generates this signal, so it
does not depend on the model following a prompt instruction. The
`--turn-end-message` CLI option overrides the config file value.

You can also override or add agent presets:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "preset": "my-agent"
  },
  "agents": {
    "my-agent": {
      "label": "My Agent",
      "description": "Internal team agent",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["my-agent-cli", "--acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Customizing bridge command names (aliases)

Bridge slash commands like `/acp-config` and `/acp-cancel` have fixed
built-in names that may not feel natural to everyone, and can clash with
slash commands built into the underlying agent. You can map any bridge
command to one or more custom aliases via the `commandAliases` config map:

```json
{
  "commandAliases": {
    "/acp-cancel": ["/cancel", "/取消", "取消"],
    "/acp-config": ["/config", "/设置"],
    "/acp-new": ["/acp-clear", "/new"]
  }
}
```

With this config:

- Sending `/取消` cancels the current turn (same as `/acp-cancel`), and
  `/取消 all` works like `/acp-cancel all`.
- Sending `/设置` lists ACP session config (same as `/acp-config`), and
  `/设置 set <configId> <value>` works like `/acp-config set ...`.
- The original built-in names always keep working as a fallback.

Two alias styles are supported:

- **Slash aliases** (start with `/`, e.g. `/cancel`) behave like the
  built-in commands: they match the command token and may be followed by
  arguments (`/cancel all`). They must not contain whitespace.
- **Bare-phrase aliases** (no leading `/`, e.g. `取消`) match only when
  they equal the *entire* message. This is handy for WeChat voice input,
  where saying `/取消` out loud feels unnatural — a transcribed `取消`
  triggers the command. Because they require an exact full-message match,
  they take no arguments.

Notes:

- Keys must be a known bridge command (`/acp-config`, `/acp-cancel`, `/acp-new`, `/acp-more`, `/acp-prompt-start`, or `/acp-prompt-done`).
- An alias may not collide with a built-in command name or be mapped to
  more than one command. Invalid configs are rejected at startup.

## Runtime Behavior

- Each WeChat user gets a dedicated ACP session and subprocess.
- With session resume enabled, persisted sessions can survive subprocess and bridge restarts.
- Messages are processed serially per user.
- Replies are formatted for WeChat before sending.
- Typing indicators are sent when supported by the WeChat API.
- Sessions are cleaned up after inactivity (set `idleTimeoutMs` to `0` to disable idle cleanup).

## Fetching text that iLink rejected

WeChat iLink limits how many outbound messages can use one inbound context
token. If a long agent reply reaches that limit and iLink reports send failures,
the bridge keeps the failed text segments for 10 minutes. Send this command in
a new WeChat message to deliver them with its fresh context token:

```text
/acp-more
```

The command is handled by the bridge and never becomes an ACP prompt. It sends
pending segments in order and stops at the first segment that still fails after
retries. That segment and the remaining segments stay pending for the next
`/acp-more`. A new normal agent prompt clears older pending output. Storage is
in memory, limited to 50 text segments per active user, and does not include
images, audio, or files.

Aliases work through `commandAliases`. Bare aliases must match the whole
message, so they are intercepted before the normal ACP enqueue path.

This mitigation can only retain failures reported by iLink. If iLink returns
success but silently drops a message, the bridge cannot detect or replay it.

## Starting a fresh ACP session

Interactive agent commands such as Copilot CLI's `/clear` cannot clear context
when they are forwarded as normal ACP prompt text. Use the bridge command
instead:

```text
/acp-new
```

The command stops the current user's active turn and agent subprocess, drops
messages queued behind that turn, clears any multi-part prompt buffer, and
removes the saved ACP session ID. The user's next normal message starts a new
agent subprocess and `session/new` conversation with the same agent, working
directory, environment, and bridge configuration.

Reset is isolated to the requesting WeChat user. Other users and the bridge
process keep running. It works with `session.resume` set to `off`, `auto`, or
`required`, and it is handled by `wechat-acp` rather than forwarded to the
underlying agent.

Use `commandAliases` to add names such as `/acp-clear` or `/new`.

## WeChat ACP config command

`wechat-acp` reserves a bridge-level chat command for inspecting and changing ACP session configuration without exposing a UI picker in WeChat:

```text
/acp-config
/acp-config set <configId> <value>
```

Examples:

```text
/acp-config
/acp-config set model gpt-5-mini
/acp-config set mode plan
/acp-config set reasoning_effort low
/acp-config set bridge.thoughts off
/acp-config set bridge.diffs on
/acp-config set bridge.images off
/acp-config set bridge.audio off
/acp-config set bridge.resources off
```

Notes:

- The command only works after the WeChat user already has an active ACP session. If not, send a normal message first so the session is created.
- Agent-specific `configId` values come from the ACP agent's `configOptions`, so that part of the list depends on the configured agent.
- The built-in `bridge.thoughts`, `bridge.diffs`, `bridge.audio`, and `bridge.resources` options control intermediate output forwarding for the current WeChat user's session. `bridge.resources off` hides tool resources, including entries from `tool_call_update.rawOutput.contents[]`. When tool resources are on, `agent.resourceInlineLimit` controls whether tool text resources are rendered inline or sent as attachments. `bridge.images` controls only inline tool images. Explicit agent resources, explicit response images, and files sent with `attach_file` are always delivered. These options use the startup config as defaults, accept `on` or `off`, and are not persisted across session resets or bridge restarts.
- Runtime bridge changes take effect on the next agent turn. They do not change a turn that is already running.
- This command is handled by `wechat-acp` itself and is **not** forwarded to the underlying agent.
- You can give this command your own aliases via `commandAliases` (see [Customizing bridge command names](#customizing-bridge-command-names-aliases)).

## WeChat ACP cancel command

WeChat does not offer a stop button for an in-flight agent turn, so the bridge exposes a chat command instead:

```text
/acp-cancel
/acp-cancel all
```

Behavior:

- `/acp-cancel` sends `session/cancel` to the agent for the current turn. The in-flight `prompt()` resolves with `stopReason: "cancelled"`, any partial output already streamed is delivered to WeChat with a `[cancelled]` suffix, and the next queued message (if any) is processed as usual.
- `/acp-cancel all` does the same and also drops every message that was queued behind the current turn. Local injections (`wechat-acp inject`) waiting on those queued messages are rejected.
- If no turn is in flight, the command replies with a notice and is a no-op.
- This command is handled by `wechat-acp` itself and is **not** forwarded to the underlying agent.
- You can give this command your own aliases via `commandAliases` (see [Customizing bridge command names](#customizing-bridge-command-names-aliases)).

## Multi-part message buffering

WeChat does not allow sending images, files, and text in a single message. To work around this, the bridge provides a buffering mode that collects multiple messages and sends them to the agent as one combined request:

```text
/acp-prompt-start
/acp-prompt-done
```

Usage:

1. Send `/acp-prompt-start` to enter buffering mode. The bridge replies with a confirmation.
2. Send any number of messages (text, images, files) in any order. These are collected locally and **not** forwarded to the agent.
3. Send `/acp-prompt-done` to flush the buffer. All collected content is combined into a single agent request.

This avoids triggering multiple agent turns (and multiple replies) when a user needs to send mixed content.

- If `/acp-prompt-done` is sent with nothing buffered, the bridge replies with a warning and no agent request is made.
- If `/acp-prompt-start` is sent while already buffering, the bridge reminds the user and keeps the existing buffer.
- Buffering is per-user and held in memory. It does not persist across bridge restarts.
- Buffers expire after 10 minutes of inactivity. A maximum of 50 content blocks can be collected per buffer.
- This command is handled by `wechat-acp` itself and is **not** forwarded to the underlying agent.

## Injecting messages locally

`wechat-acp inject` lets local automation enqueue a text message for the running daemon. The daemon treats it like an incoming direct message from the target user, sends it to the configured ACP agent, and replies through WeChat.

This is useful for cron or launchd jobs, for example a daily AI news prompt:

```bash
npx wechat-acp inject --instance main --text "今日 AI 资讯"
```

Targets:

- Default target: `last-active-user`
- Custom target: `--to <wechat-user-id>`

The daemon learns `last-active-user` from real incoming WeChat messages and stores the latest `userId + contextToken` under the instance storage directory. If no user has messaged the bot yet, ask the target user to send any message once, then retry the injection.

Injected messages are stored as JSON files under:

```text
~/.wechat-acp/inject/
~/.wechat-acp/instances/<name>/inject/
```

The queue is file-based:

```text
inject/
├── pending/
├── processing/
├── done/
└── failed/
```

`inject` only writes to `pending/`; the daemon moves files through the other directories as it processes them. If the daemon is not running, the message remains queued and will be processed after the daemon starts.

For longer prompts, use a file:

```bash
npx wechat-acp inject --instance main --file ./prompt.txt
```

Example Linux cron entry:

```cron
0 7 * * * /usr/local/bin/wechat-acp inject --instance main --text "今日 AI 资讯"
```

## Receiving files

When a WeChat user sends a binary file (PDF, image, audio recording exported as a file, ZIP, etc.), `wechat-acp` downloads and decrypts it from the WeChat CDN, then **saves it to disk** so the ACP agent can read it by absolute path. The agent receives a text block like:

```
[Received file: 报告.pdf (484067 bytes) — saved to: /Users/me/.wechat-acp/inbox/2026-05-21T09-29-12-492Z-报告.pdf]
```

Any ACP agent that can read local files (Copilot CLI, Claude Code, Codex, …) can then open the saved path with its normal file tools.

Defaults:

- Save location: `<storage.dir>/inbox`, i.e. `~/.wechat-acp/inbox` by default, or `~/.wechat-acp/instances/<name>/inbox` when `--instance` is used.
- Filename: `<ISO-timestamp>-<original-name>`, with filesystem-unsafe characters in the original name replaced by `_`. Unicode (including Chinese) filenames are preserved.
- No automatic cleanup. Files live until you delete them; agents may reference them long after the WeChat message arrives. Periodically run e.g. `find ~/.wechat-acp/inbox -mtime +30 -delete` if you want to prune.

Overrides:

- `--inbox-dir /some/path` — write files somewhere else (handy if you want them under iCloud Drive, a project folder, etc.)
- `--no-inbox` — keep the pre-0.3 behavior where the file buffer is dropped after download and the agent only sees `[Received file: name, N bytes]`.

Text-typed files (`.md`, `.json`, source code, …) and images keep their previous behavior: their content is embedded inline in the prompt as a `resource` / `image` block, no disk write needed.

## Receiving agent-generated files

When the ACP agent advertises HTTP MCP support, `wechat-acp` injects a local
`attach_file` tool into the session. The agent can call it with a file it
created under the configured working directory, and the bridge sends that
snapshot back as a WeChat file message. Files whose type is a supported image
are delivered as native WeChat images instead of file cards.

Tool calls may also expose intermediate screenshots or video frames as inline
images. Use `--hide-images` or `agent.showImages: false` to suppress them.
Images that the agent explicitly emits in its response are always sent.
Images sent through `attach_file` are always sent.

Tool text resources up to `agent.resourceInlineLimit` characters are shown
inline. Longer tool text resources are sent as file attachments. The default is
`1000`; set `--resource-inline-limit 0` to attach every non-empty tool text
resource. Use `--hide-resources` or `/acp-config set bridge.resources off` to
hide intermediate tool resources. Explicit agent resources and `attach_file`
results are still delivered.

The MCP server listens only on a random `127.0.0.1` port, requires a
process-local bearer token, rejects browser-origin requests, and only reads
regular files whose resolved path stays inside the agent working directory.
Files are limited to 25 MiB, kept briefly in memory, and consumed once.

This also handles standard ACP `resource_link` output and Copilot CLI's
`rawOutput.contents[type=resource_link]` compatibility shape. Agents that do
not support HTTP MCP injection or do not forward resource links cannot use the
active `attach_file` flow. Resource visibility settings do not disable the tool
or its outbound file delivery.

## Storage

By default, runtime files are stored under:

```text
~/.wechat-acp
```

This directory is used for:

- saved login token
- daemon pid file
- daemon log file
- sync state
- anonymous telemetry install id (`telemetry-id`, see Telemetry section)
- `inbox/` — binary files received from WeChat (see "Receiving files"); disable with `--no-inbox` or relocate with `--inbox-dir`
- `state.json` — last active user and context token for local injection
- `inject/` — local injected message queue

When `--instance <name>` is used, the same files live under `~/.wechat-acp/instances/<name>/` instead, fully isolated from other instances.

## Current Limitations

- Direct messages only; group chats are ignored
- Agent-generated file delivery depends on the agent's HTTP MCP and resource-link support
- Permission requests are auto-approved
- Agent communication is subprocess-only over stdio
- Some preset agents may require separate authentication before they can respond successfully

## Development

For local development:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the built CLI locally:

```bash
node dist/bin/wechat-acp.js --help
```

Watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Telemetry

`wechat-acp` collects anonymous usage telemetry via Azure Application Insights to help understand which agent presets are used and to detect crashes.

**To disable telemetry**, set the `WECHAT_ACP_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `0`, `false`, or `off` before running:

```bash
WECHAT_ACP_TELEMETRY=0 npx wechat-acp --agent copilot
```

**What is collected** (18 event types only):

- `app.start` / `app.stop` — process lifecycle, agent preset name, daemon flag, uptime
- `login.success` / `login.failure` / `token.reused` — WeChat login outcomes (no token, no QR URL)
- `message.received` — message arrived; only the categorical kind (`text` / `image` / `voice` / `file` / `video` / `empty`) and a hashed user id
- `message.injected` — local injection queued for processing; only target kind (`last-active-user` / `explicit`) and a hashed user id
- `command.acp_config.view` — `/acp-config` invoked to list options; whether a session exists and the option count
- `command.acp_config.set`: `/acp-config set` succeeded; `configId`, option type (`select` / `boolean`), and the resolved option value (from either a built-in bridge option or the agent's declared `configOptions`, never the user's raw input)
- `command.acp_cancel` — `/acp-cancel` invoked; whether the queue was drained, whether an in-flight turn was actually cancelled, and how many queued messages were dropped
- `command.buffer_start` — `/acp-prompt-start` invoked to enter buffering mode
- `command.buffer_done` — `/acp-prompt-done` invoked to flush buffer; number of content blocks collected
- `session.created` — new ACP session opened
- `prompt.completed` — ACP turn finished; agent preset, stop reason, duration, reply length
- `reply.sent` — reply pushed back to WeChat; segment count, total length
- `reply.image.sent`: image reply pushed back to WeChat; byte size, MIME type, duration
- `reply.audio.sent`: audio reply pushed back to WeChat as a file message; byte size, MIME type, duration
- `reply.file.sent`: agent-generated file pushed back to WeChat; byte size, MIME type, duration

Plus exception reports for `monitor`, `prompt`, `reply`, `reply.image`, `reply.audio`, `reply.file`, `artifact_mcp`, `auth`, `agent_spawn`, `enqueue`, `buffer`, `command`, and `state` failures.

**What is never collected**: message bodies, filenames, voice transcripts, image URLs, login tokens, QR codes, raw agent command strings, environment variables, working directory paths, raw WeChat user IDs.

User IDs are sha256-hashed with a per-install salt stored in `~/.wechat-acp/telemetry-id`. The salt is generated on first run and never leaves your machine. Delete the file to rotate it.
